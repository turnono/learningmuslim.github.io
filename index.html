                                Each lesson comprises of 4 components (tasked to different teachers),
                                Nahw (Grammar), Sarf (Morphology), Quraan Translation and an Arabic reader.
                                Our unique syllabus is designed to maximise the understanding of core concepts
                                in the shortest time possible. This is achieved by harmonizing theory and practical application
                                to the study of the Quraan and Arabic readers while integrating
                                learning assistive technologies such as Google Classroom and our own "Iraab" tool.

                                            “For some strange reason, I grew up with the belief that understanding Arabic (for Quraan and the Islamic Sciences specifically)
                                            was meant for Scholars and Shuyookh, and I moved through life satisfied with a copy of my Quraan translation.
                                            It is only by Allah’s Grace that I stumbled upon Learning Muslim, not fully comprehending the decision that I was about to make.
                                            A few months into the course, I realised that my initial belief was warped and that this is a language that anyone can acquire.
                                            Alhamdulillah, this was partly because my teachers explained the Arabic rules concisely, and I found myself easily understand it.
                                            My teachers were patient and gentle — something which lacked in some of my Madrassah experiences. There was also mahabah (love) amongst the students,
                                            and this increased my love for the religion, and Learning Muslim became more than just my weekly Arabic classes.
                                            The Quraan can be accessible to you, in all its splendor, if you immerse yourself in studying it.
                                            Learning Muslim has changed my life and become part of my extended family. Their simplified approach, their professionalism towards what they do,
                                            and the sincere care for their students is what sets them apart, Alhamdulillah. May Allah continue to bless my teachers and my school.”

                                I would encourage all, young an old, to become part of the Learning Muslim family."

                                            1. I decided to embark on this journey with Learning Muslim to learn the fundamentals of the Arabic language,
                                            through learning Grammar (Nahwu) and Word Construction (Sarf). Through this, my reading of the Quran,
                                            would be improved by understanding the meaning, context, and interpretation of Allah's divine message.
                                            My aim was ultimately to obtain reward for the pleasure of Allah, in my humble attempt at increasing my knowledge of what
                                            Allah has blessed us and ordained through His words.
                                            2. It has been an amazing journey being part of the Learning Muslim family.
                                            Studying at Learning Muslim not only improves one's understanding of Arabic,
                                            but also gaining access to a vast ocean of Islamic knowledge through the set curricula and advice from the esteemed teachers.
                                            The learning environment is interactive where all Islamic concepts are applied logically and practically to today's contemporary and challenging world.
                                            3. Studying at Learning Muslim is a journey towards spiritual enlightenment, where one takes time out of the busy week,
                                            to increase knowledge and ultimately practicing upon divine scriptures of Quran and Hadith.
                                            I would encourage all, young an old, to become part of the Learning Muslim family,
                                            where we are all committed to progressing our collective knowledge of Islam.

                            No prior knowledge of Arabic is required. The course is aimed at complete beginners.<br>
                            However, students are required to have
                            a basic ability to read the Quran
                            although students will never be asked to read in class.<br>

                            Students also need to have the commitment to revise the work covered every week as well as complete
                            the homework exercises. This will require about 2 hours of revision every week.

                            <strong>Presentation of Classes</strong><br>
                            The course is presented via MSPowerPoint.<br>
                            Each lesson will be reinforced with numerous examples and exercises to ensure the student gains mastery of the concepts before moving on to the next one. This will also include homework tutorials.
                            <br>Lessons are interactive, fun and spiritually uplifting with both group and individual learning.
                            <br>
                            Students are never singled out for questions and assessments are optional.
                            <br>The learning environment is comfortable and relaxed.

                            <br><br><strong>Technology to aid learning – a “blended-learning approach”</strong><br>
                            Classes are integrated with Google Classroom and presentations are accessible to students if required. <br>
                            All class audio along with presentation and study materials is uploaded every week to enable students to catch-up on missed lessons or review class material.
                            <br> Concept videos are sent to students to prepare before class or review work covered – this frees up more time for interaction in class.

                            Questions can be sent via email and Whatsapp between classes.

                            Please note that we prioritize the dissemination of knowledge above all and will not turn down any student who cannot afford the whole fee

                            Our course objective is to understand the Quran. This is not necessarily dependent on having the ability to speak
                            Arabic.<br> Based on this (as well as our South African context and time constraints), we have not designed the course
                            so as to achieve a proficiency in speaking Arabic.
